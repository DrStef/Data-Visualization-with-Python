#  Data Visualization with Python


This project was part of IBM Data Science certificate. https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science <br>
It was completed in May 2022. 
<br> 

### **Canadian Immigration Dataset:  waffle chart, word cloud.** 

We improved the initial Notebook with better graphs. <br> We used a map of Canada and contour as a mask for the word cloud of immigration main countries of origin.

### **Generating Maps with Python** 

Maps with Folium with various options: Stamen Toner, Stamen Terrain,... <br>  
Maps with markers: Visulaing features of San Francisco crime dataset.  <br>
Maps with choropleth: Visualizing countries of origin, Canadian Immigration dataset. <br>

### **US Domestic Airline Flights Performance.** 

Analysis/Visualization with Dashboard including histograms, pie chart, map (choropleth), treemap.<br>
Improved presentation, and confusing line plots were replaced with histograms.<br>
Interactive Dashboard does not work with MyBinder. Notebook must be downloaded and run with proper libraries.
