### **Canadian Immigration Dataset:  waffle chart, word cloud.** 

We improved the initial Notebook with better graphs. <br> We used a map of Canada and contour as a mask for the word cloud of immigration main countries of origin.

### **US Domestic Airline Flights Performance.** 

Analysis/Visualization with Dashboard including histograms, pie chart, map (choropleth), treemap.<br>
Improved presentation, and confusing line plots were replaced with histograms.<br>
Interactive Dashboard does not work with MyBinder. Notebook must be downloaded and run with proper libraries.
